:shadowman:Well that doesn't matter.
:shadowman:Do you guys not know the situation you're in?
:bfhmm:Ack! He's right!
:bfhmm:If he turns off the console, we'll have no way of getting out.
:senpai:Console?
:bfhmm:Again, you wouldn't get it.
:monikagaspleft:But isn't Senpai like really powerful now?
:senpai:But i'm not-
:bfhmm:She meant me you halfwit.
:shadowman:I'm not just some simple minded fool.
:shadowman:I made a lil device to make sure that Senpai's powers are nullified until you fulfill my demands.
:shadowman:After all, I did come up with this entire storyline.
:monikagaspleft:Huh?
:bfhmm:Yeah. I don't get any of the stuff he says either.
:tankmanangry:What do you want anyway?
:shadowman:Well.
:shadowman:I hacked the game and switched Bara No Yume with a new song I created for you guys to sing.
:shadowman:Now all you guys have to do is sing the song and give me your opinions on it.
:monikagaspleft:So that's why the song crashed.
:bfhmm:That's it?
:tankmanhmm:That should be easy enough.
:shadowman:Great! Just let me finish setting up!
:senpai:Wait a minute!
:senpai:I still haven't allowed you to use my mic! Give it back!
:monikagasp:Again, it's not-
:senpai:I said GIVE IT!
:monikagasp:N-no!
:bfhmm:Again. Very awkward.
:bfhmm:Let's just get this over with.
:shadowman:Ah crap!
:shadowman:I may or may not have accidentally broke the arrows.
:bfhmm:Who cares! We'll deal with it.
:bfhmm:Just start the song!
:shadowman:Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
