Xinyan's liking to music carries over to her social life, so she's friends with Barbara, Xingqiu, Hu Tao and Venti
    -Although she admits that she and Barbara are 2 very different singers, she would like to do a duet with her sometime
The archons are able to tolerate her music, although Ei does admit it being a bit too loud for her tastes
Xinyan is friendly with Keqing, they sometimes talk about rock n' roll and other stuff
Xinyan tried playing CS:GO (and still does), but she only occasionally plays it due to her being easily aggravated
Although Xinyan can literally scream to chip off opponents' HP, her special ability rather has to do with her guitar
    -She can switch to guitar mode, which puts her in a daredevil kind of state
        -Notes give more HP, while misses take more HP. Essentially, all HP change is amplified
Sometimes, Venti will play a few tunes with Xinyan during their spare time. The tunes vary between rock n' roll to calm poetry-like tunes
Xinyan is friends with BF and GF, and is friendly with Aloe and Nenechi
    -While Nenechi is fine with her music, Aloe says it's a bit too loud for her
Xinyan gets along well with Sunday. She did a collab with her once
