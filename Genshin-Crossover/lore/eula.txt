Eula is friends with BF, GF and Pico
Eula initially retained her wording around vengeance, and it nearly caused a scuffle between her and Whitty
    -They are on good terms now, though
Eula is friendly with Shenhe and Ayaka
    -Funny enough, all 3 people are somewhat secluded Cryo female characters
        -In addition, both Ayaka and Eula have a Pyro friend (Thoma for Ayaka, and Amber for Eula)
Eula and Ei actually do get along
    -Ei is impressed by Eula's dance-like bladework, while Eula is amazed by Ei's mastery of both the polearm and the sword
Eula sometimes dances as a little pastime
    -She might invite BF or Barbara to sing along with the dance, or Venti to play some tunes
    -Ganyu sometimes spectates
Eula once misinterpreted what Whitty was saying while he was trying out a game
    -She facepalmed after learning that her name was also the term for "End User License Agreement"
Eula does game a little, mostly with Amber
    -Although you can hear her sometimes say her catchphrase, she doesn't rage hard unlike Xinyan
Eula does play Genshin Impact, but only sometimes (she doesn't game often). She mainly uses her own character and Ei (the Eula/Ei combo)
Eula got a part-time job in the military as a scout, alongside Pico and Amber
    -Sometimes, BF and GF would join them acting as decoys
        -BF and GF would lure the enemy out, while the latter sights behind enemy lines for info, then report to Tankman, who handles the rest
Eula sometimes reads in the library, occasionally asking Lisa for recommendations on a good read
Although she doesn't show it, Eula is good with rifles
    -She hopes to embed a similar firearm into her claymore in the future
