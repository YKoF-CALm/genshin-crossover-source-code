Aether is the canon Traveler in this universe. However, following Lumine's temporary hiatus as the leader of the Abyss Order, both of them have become Travelers
    -Although they are sometimes still referred to as "Traveler", the Genshin characters and most of the FNF characters do refer to them as their own names
Aether uses his spare time to plan his journey back in Teyvat to find Lumine
While it's not revealed in any cover just yet, Paimon did come along with Aether to the FNF world
Aether is friendly with everyone
Aether will sometimes hang out with BF and Aloe
Aether is more or less the "fixer" in the Genshin house, much like how Thoma is the "fixer" in Ritou
    -This means that the Genshin characters sometimes get to meet each other thanks to Aether's connections
Aether came into the FNF world brandishing the Anemo element. However, thanks to BF and GF's help, he is able to wield any element any time without the need to switch
Aether is looking to upgrade his sword
Aether has the best hand-to-hand combat skills in the Genshin house
For unknown reasons, Aether was warped into the FNF world with a mic
    -The same applies to Lumine
Aether is an all-rounded gamer, able to take up any game in a relatively short amount of time
Aether plays Genshin Impact, and regularly switches his main characters
    -He is the first Genshin character to not often main his own character
Although Aether doesn't know about Ayaka's crush on him, he has gained some suspicion after hearing her voice lines in Genshin Impact
Aether sometimes works on his combat abilities during his free time
    -Aside from his sword and mic, he has also mastered the bow, and is working on the claymore
While Paimon doesn't constantly hang around Aether anymore in the FNF world, she still spends a lot of time with him
Both Aether and Lumine are MCs in their own game, so they do have "protagonist power"
    -Essentially, both are able to actively drain their opponents' health through rap battles, similar to BF and Aloe
        -However, neither of them have a revive ability. In these cases, BF or Aloe are usually the ones to take the fatal blow
