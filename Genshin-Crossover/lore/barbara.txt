Barbara was warped to just outside of Sarvente's church, where she meets Sarvente
    -As Sarvente doesn't really care much about people who have joined other churches, Barbara and Sarvente got off to a good start
The reason why Holy Mami was there is because she was sent to eliminate magical girls, and Barbara was considered to be one of them
    -Although, Holy Mami wasn't sent to kill Barbara specifically, she just sensed her presence and went to check it out
Sarvente managed to subdue Holy Mami before she could get to Barbara, and called BF and GF. By the time they arrived though, Holy Mami had pretty much broken out of her restraints
    -This pretty much led to the Gospel cover
Barbara won the rap battle due to her already developed singing skills, and Holy Mami reverted to her normal form, realizing the damage she had done, and left subsequently after apologizing
Barbara moved into the Genshin house with help from BF and GF
Barbara is currently Klee's main caretaker
    -Her duties were passed on to Albedo after his arrival, although she still helps out sometimes
Barbara is friends with Xingqiu and Hu Tao. The trio sometimes have singing sessions, and Klee would sometimes chime in, too
Barbara is friends with Ayaka. They would sometimes take walks and hang out together
    -They have run into danger a few times. However, due to the compatibility of Hydro and Cryo, they will mostly come out unscathed, only suffering a bruise or 2
        -Even then, Barbara is able to heal them both
Barbara is friends with BF, GF, Mami, Sarvente and Carol
    -Through BF, she met and befriended Hatsune Miku as well
Barbara would like to befriend Whitty and Ruv, but is nervous to do so
    -She describes Whitty as "an intimidating walking bomb" and Ruv as "a loud, powerful madman"
Barbara is one of the few people Ganyu allows to touch her horns
    -Ganyu once suffered a hit that caused a bump near one of her horns. It irritated Ganyu quite severely, but she attempted to ignore it
    -Barbara noticed this, and decided to heal Ganyu. Although she was hesitant, Ganyu eventually accepted, as the bump became too severe for her to ignore
    -Barbara was aware of the situation with her horns, and she was very gentle while treating Ganyu. In the end, the bump healed faster than expected
    -The "bump" was actually an inflammation, and Barbara got rid of it, leading Ganyu to feel safe the next time she sustains an injury, even if it concerns her horns
Although GF and Carol sometimes drop by to cook, Barbara is the main cook for the Genshin house
Barbara has her spare outfit (Summertime Sparkle) with her, and she sometimes wears it for casual wear
Barbara does have a special ability while singing
    -If need be, she can fully regain her HP during a rap battle
Barbara sometimes visits Sarvente's church with Rosaria
    -She would pray with Sarvente, while Rosaria would hang out with Ruv
