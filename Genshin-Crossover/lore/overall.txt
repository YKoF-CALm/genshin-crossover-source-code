Arrows (and arrow mechanics) change based on the song
Characters from their own mods are able to retain their own arrows if the song permits it (usually if the song doesn't specifically use any custom arrow skins)
Genshin characters can't retain their own arrows, except for Eula, Amber and Hu Tao, who have their own mods
The Ludi Harpastum notes (ludinotes in the images folder) are the default Genshin notes
In this universe, Holofunk and the general modded universe are combined, so the vanilla characters are who they are
Aloe and Nenechi are canonically friends with BF and GF in this universe
Although Teyvat (the Genshin universe) is also canon to this universe and DOES EXIST as a separate continent, Genshin Impact still exists as a video game in this universe
    -However, the characters come from the actual Teyvat itself, not the Teyvat in-game
Enkanomiya exists here too. Just putting it here
The Chasm exists too. Just saying
GF plays Genshin Impact, so she knows all the characters. She plays it with Nenechi sometimes
BF and Aloe know about the game, but aren't too clear on the details of it, needing their speaker counterparts to explain some of the characters for them when they do meet the actual characters
The Genshin characters that BF and the gang meet all stay at a house BF and GF bought. This house is similar to Edd's house, and can be seen in the Challeng-EDD cover
    -However, this house is NOT the house that BF and GF stay in. They have their own home, don't worry about it
The character stats in the mod are as follows:
    -Triple-crowned talents (for Aether, he has 9 crowns)
    -R5 refinement for their signature weapons
    -C6
    -Max level (at the moment, all are level 90)
    -Artifact-wise, they are variable among characters, but most of them lean towards a damage build (if viable). Otherwise, they retain certain support builds, depending on their character usage
        -However, all their artifacts are 5-star, and are maxed out
    -Friendship level 10
The Genshin Impact lore and FNF modverse lore both apply to this mod all the same
Only catalyst users have no need to wield their weapons in order to attack (unless if the characters throw hands). This only applies to this mod
    -Catalyst users can simply "throw" their elemental energy rather than needed to rely on a catalyst to do so
BETADCIUs aren't canon
Duality isn't a canon cover
    -You can probably treat it as a dream of some sorts from one of the characters involved
Self-insert OCs and other non-mod-based OCs (i.e. OCs that don't have a mod dedicated to them) can be canon
    -Okay, being IRL a bit here, I don't really know if this is a good idea, but I guess I can always retract it anytime if I have to
    -I might include more of these OCs into the lore. Just saying
