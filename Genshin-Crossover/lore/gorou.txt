Gorou is still ever loyal to Kokomi
Gorou is able to communicate and coexist with everyone in the Genshin house, but he does have a few qualms
    -He isn't particularly fond of Ei for obvious reasons
    -He is scared of Yae Miko for, again, obvious reasons
    -He is slightly intimidated by Zhongli and Shenhe, since they "appear rather formidable"
    -He is scared of Lisa for the same reasons as Yae Miko
    -He is slightly nervous around Klee, mainly because Klee always likes to pet him and treat him like a dog
Gorou would like to meet Kapi, but is concerned that Kapi might be scared of him
Gorou does have a part-time job in the military, working as an army general
    -Tankman likes his style
While Gorou and Ei didn't quite get along from the get-go, they did manage to settle down after getting some desserts, as both of them have quite a sweet tooth
BF is curious if Gorou can eat chocolate at all, as he is half-canine
