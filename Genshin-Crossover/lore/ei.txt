Ei is friends with Aloe and Nenechi
Ei attacked BF because she sensed that BF has a mysterious power, and is probably hostile considering that he wants to "battle her", not to mention that he's dating a demon
    -This was a misunderstanding on Ei's part, as BF usually shortens "rap battle" to just "battle"
    -BF's mysterious power is just his "RETRY" ability
After the Ectospasm cover, Ei befriended BF and GF
Ei is on good terms with Xiao and Yoimiya, and is friends with Keqing
As seen in the Ectospasm cover, Ei can spawn lightning arrows that kill you instantly when missed
In her spare time, Ei visits the library at the Genshin house
Ei is usually keen to accept a request to spar with her
    -So far, she's taken on the most sparring matches at the Genshin house
Ei still retains her sweet tooth, and does pack a few cookies when she goes out in case she gets hungry
Ei was initially confused about Whitty when seeing him accompany Carol and Klee. However, everything was cleared up after she understood Whitty's situation
The Confronting Yourself cover (CYS) essentially reenacts the battle between Ei and the Raiden Shogun. However, instead of a normal fight, the Raiden Shogun observed how rap battles work, and challenged Ei to one
    -Ei accepted, but knew that she was weak in rap battles, so she kept her distance, while the Raiden Shogun tried to close it, hence the chase
Ei's energy level was at 50% during CYS, so BF and Aloe managed to recharge her to max level
    Ei couldn't recharge herself, as she had to keep a distance, rendering her unable to use her Elemental Skill on the Raiden Shogun, hence why she needed their help
Ei has heard of the Doki Doki Literature Club, and wishes to visit there sometime
Due to the differences between worlds, Ei is unable to stay in the Plane of Euthymia for extended periods of time. Hence, she spends most of her time in the overworld
