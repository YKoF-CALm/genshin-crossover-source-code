Keqing met BF and GF during the Madness cover. She thought that they were being attacked by Tricky, when in reality, they were just looking to rap battle with him
Keqing is friends with BF and GF
    -Later on, she would also befriend Pico
Keqing is friends with Ei and Ganyu (duh)
Keqing befriended BF because he has battled and defeated gods (e.g. Shaggy, Matt), and Keqing would like to train with him to achieve a similar feat
Keqing would occasionally train with Ei
Although Keqing isn't fond of Daddy Dearest, she is fond of Mommy Mearest. The 2, along with GF, would sometimes go shopping
While Keqing was initially hostile to Tricky, she is on relatively neutral terms with him now
Surprisingly, Keqing did pick up Genshin Impact after being recommended by GF. She mainly plays her own character, but would sometimes switch to Yanfei or Hu Tao
Keqing still likes Golden Shrimp Balls, but is decently content on the seafood dishes in the FNF world
While Keqing isn't particularly interested in the literature club, she is interested in Monika, whom she heard can alter reality within games
    -She got her info from BF and GF
    -She wishes to talk to her about these abilities and train with her sometime
Keqing sometimes plays CS:GO with Ganyu. She's decent at the game, but not very outstanding at it. She's usually a support rifler
Keqing DOES have her alt outfit (Opulent Splendor) with her, she keeps it in her room as a spare outfit
