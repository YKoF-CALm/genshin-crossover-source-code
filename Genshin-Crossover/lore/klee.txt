Klee was warped to an old building, where she found Whitty. She thought he was hostile, but saw that he had a mic, so she asked to sing with him (Kaboom cover)
    -However, she planned to attack him while singing, which didn't turn out well
After the fight, Carol came up, after hearing the fight, and managed to convince Klee that Whitty was friendly
Klee stayed with Carol and Whitty for a few days while Carol informs GF on the situation
    -Klee then moved into the Genshin house about a week later
Klee is friends with BF, GF, Whitty, Carol, Hex, Aloe and Nenechi
Klee is friends with Yoimiya and Hu Tao
Klee frequently talks to the people in the Genshin house before Barbara's arrival, as she misses home and doesn't wish to be lonely
    -Yoimiya and Hu Tao sometimes keep her company for that reason
    -The people in the Genshin house have mixed reactions, but all of them aren't negative
        -Xiao will give a bit of small talk before disappearing
        -Keqing and Ganyu would chat with her a little longer, sometimes consoling her if need be
        -Ei and Zhongli are more parental, and are able to sustain conversations with her just fine
            -Sometimes, Ei would give her some treats
        -Chongyun sometimes hands her a popsicle while trying to make conversation
        -Xingqiu can sustain conversation, but is more casual in that sense
        -Shenhe struggles to make small talk, to the point where Klee even offered to help her on her social skills
After Barbara moved in, Klee stuck around her a lot, as she was the closest person Klee had to her familiars
    -The same applies to Aether
Klee sometimes trains with Whitty, due to him being able to understand Klee's powers
Tabi actually tried to trick Klee into helping him kill GF by asking her to send a "gift" to her doorstep
    -However, when Klee took out the Jumpty Dumpty to be used for the "gift", it slipped and ended up exploding on Tabi
        -While Tabi survived the explosion, his clothes were slightly burned and he sustained a bump due to him falling over from the blast
        -Ever since then, he has refrained from interacting with Klee
Klee sometimes would join in on Barbara's singing sessions with Hu Tao and Xingqiu
