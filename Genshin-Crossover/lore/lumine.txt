Currently, the canon Traveler in this timeline is Aether, so Lumine is the leader of the Abyss Order. However, she was warped to the alleyway, where she met and battled Xiao
After the battle, Xiao and Lumine are on good terms, but they went their separate ways
    -Before separating, they did have a little chat, during which Xiao mentioned Aether
After Xiao left, Lumine pondered for a while before deciding to put down her role as leader of the Abyss Order, seeing that the Abyss Order isn't here anyways. She proceeded to become another Traveler
Before Lumine's meetup with Aether, Lumine didn't know about the Genshin house
Lumine was warped into this world with a mic
    -How and why it happened is unknown
    -This also applies to Aether
After the meetup with Aether, Lumine befriended BF (and GF shortly after), and joined the Genshin house
Lumine likes to chat about with Yae Miko and Ayaka
Lumine knows about Ayaka's crush on Aether
Lumine does play Genshin. Much like Aether, she constantly swaps her main character
    -In terms of their chosen Traveler, they chose themselves (obviously)
Lumine is friendly with everyone in the Genshin house, save for the archons
    -She is, however, on good terms with the archons
Sometimes, Lumine does babysit Klee if necessary. She does enjoy taking care of her, however, she states that "the bombs could be a problem sometimes"
Both Aether and Lumine are MCs in their own game, so they do have "protagonist power"
    -Essentially, both are able to actively drain their opponents' health through rap battles, similar to BF and Aloe
        -However, neither of them have a revive ability. In these cases, BF or Aloe are usually the ones to take the fatal blow
Although Lumine isn't the canon Traveler, she inherited some elemental abilities from Aether. Hence, she can use the skills that Aether has gained all the same
    -She has the same stats as Aether (refer to the overall lore for this)
