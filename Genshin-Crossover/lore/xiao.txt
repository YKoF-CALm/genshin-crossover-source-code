Xiao was warped to Whitty's alleyway along with Lumine
Xiao doesn't know that Lumine was the leader of the Abyss Order, despite battling her, so after the Ballistic cover, they are on good terms
    -He also doesn't know that she's Aether's sibling, however he does sense a hint of familiarity on her with someone he knows
Xiao is friends with Zhongli and Ganyu
Xiao isn't particularly fond of GF's family, but is alright with GF herself
    -This is mostly because of their demon nature. GF usually has a human-like appearance and has shown kindness to Xiao, so she is an exception
Strangely, while Aloe is biologically a demon, Xiao has no qualms with her from the get-go, unlike GF
Xiao still only likes mild foods, especially Almond Tofu. However, when GF and Carol sometimes drop by to cook, Xiao can eat pretty much anything, even if the food is far from mild
    -When asked, he simply states that it's just him repaying the kindness they've shown
Xiao is slightly special in rap battles. Aside from screen shaking, he CAN actually summon Phantom notes, it's not just a gimmick in Ganyu's nightmare (the Triple Trouble cover)
    -However, he has yet to be able to do both at once
    -Main reason that Xiao has these abilities is because he's an adeptus
Xiao has sparred with the Raiden Shogun AND Ei. He has only won 1 match against the Raiden Shogun and 1 against Ei
Xiao sometimes trains his (slightly demonic) adeptal arts with GF
Xiao took on a job as an independent mercenary. During his free time, he sometimes reads in the library in the Genshin house
Xiao has trained Ganyu before, and occasionally still does
