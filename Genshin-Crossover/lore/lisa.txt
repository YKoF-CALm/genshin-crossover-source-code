Although Lisa is on friendly terms with BF and GF, they can sometimes get creeped out by her wording, as she does tend to use somewhat flirtatious speech
Lisa is fairly acquainted with the Mondstadt characters, and is friends with Xingqiu, Ayaka and Ei
Sometimes, Lisa would drop some advice on how to "talk" with Aether for Ayaka
    -As for whether or not it's a friendly joke, it's half friendly joke
Lisa will often give recommendations to Xingqiu and Ei if they are unable to find a book that pertains to them
Lisa sometimes interacts with Xiao, but doesn't talk to him much due to his rather introverted nature
Lisa occasionally helps Klee with her bombs
    -Whitty is sometimes there to control the power of the bomb, as he says that Lisa's advice might sometimes give a "nuclear" result
Carol sometimes goes to Lisa for relationship advice
