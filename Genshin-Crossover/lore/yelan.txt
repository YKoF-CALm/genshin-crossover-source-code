Yelan appeared outside a theatre, where she witnessed Barbara and Venti putting on a performance. She was invited to be a special guest onstage
Only after Venti's consultation did they decide to bring Yelan back to the Genshin house
Yelan is friendly with Lisa and Yae Miko
Yelan's intelligence gathering skills have come in handy for the group, as well as for BF and his friends
    -She works for the military (AKA with Tankman) as an intelligence officer, and she also provides BF with information about any dangers in the vicinity (i.e. anyone who might be looking for a challenge with him)
