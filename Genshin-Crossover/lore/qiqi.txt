Qiqi gets along well with everyone, with the exception of Hu Tao (for obvious reasons)
Ei easily befriended Qiqi by managing to get a finch for her
    -Yae Miko didn't eat the finch, or let the kitsune spirit eat it, don't worry
Wihle Qiqi is aware that Yae Miko sometimes might let her kitsune spirits eat finches, she was alright with her, as Miko tries her best not to let the spirits snag the finches when Qiqi is nearby
Qiqi and Hu Tao are slowly coming to terms with one another
Qiqi has met Tricky once
    -Tricky finds it absurd that she's actually a zombie, while Qiqi thinks that Tricky is too loud
        -Hank found the meeting rather humourous, and rather than going after Tricky, he stayed silently on the sidelines and watched them interact. His position was given away because he accidentally snickered
Although GF and Nenechi are comfortable with Qiqi, they try NOT to do their wishes in Genshin Impact when she is nearby (at least, for the character and weapon banners)
Qiqi did get pranked once by being directed to Ganyu when she asked where she could find coconut milk
    -This was a huge embarassment for Ganyu, and she went straight after Hu Tao, who was the one that directed Qiqi to her
        -Granted, she did become a huge laughingstock for about 10 seconds
